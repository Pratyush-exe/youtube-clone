# Youtube Clone
I designed a simple youtube clone using __React.js__, __Router-dom__ (for nagivation within pages), __material-ui__ (for icons), and finally deployed it using __firebase__.


[Click here](https://clone-f02d8.web.app/) to visit the clone website.

When the website is visited, it shows the first recommended videos from youtuve. The videos currently shown are hardcoded into the website. And when the search button is clicked, its takes user to the a clone of youtube channel _Kruzgestagt_. User can go back to the home page by clicking on the _youtube logo_.
